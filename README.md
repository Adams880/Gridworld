# Gridworld
Gridworld Project for AI class at Kennesaw State University

This project was created to show off SARSA-λ learning algorithm for a gridworld enviroment. The program will drop the AI in a random location on the grid map and depending on the number of iterations of the map the AI will search focusing on exploration or exploitataion using a greedy algorithm. The AI will eventually only exploit once it has learned enough to know where the exit should be at any point on the map.

This project was never totally finished as walls were designed to be implemented and I want to go back and redesign the GUI using JavaFX. The algorithm works however and is a very rudimentary example of SARSA-λ learning.
